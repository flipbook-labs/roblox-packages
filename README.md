# roblox-packages

Tool for extracting Luau packages from Roblox Studio.

## Installation

The preferred installation method is using [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit), a toolchain manager for Roblox projects. Rokit can manage your installed version of roblox-packages and other ecosystem tools, and allows you to easily upgrade to newer versions as they become available.

### Installing Rokit

Follow the installation instructions on the Rokit page.

### Installing roblox-packages

Navigate to your project directory using your terminal, and run the following command:
Terminal

```
rokit add flipbook-labs/roblox-packages
```

### Upgrading roblox-packages

When a new version of roblox-packages becomes available, Rokit makes it easy to upgrade. Navigate to your project directory using your terminal again, and run the following command:
Terminal

```
rokit update flipbook-labs/roblox-packages
```

If you prefer to install roblox-packages globally and have it accessible on your entire system, instead of only in a specific project, you can do this with Rokit as well. Just add the --global option to the end of the commands above.
```sh
rokit add flipbook-labs/roblox-packages
```

You can download pre-built binaries for most systems directly from the GitHub Releases page. There are many tools that can install binaries directly from releases, and itâ€™s up to you to choose what tool to use. Lune is compatible with both Foreman and Aftman.
